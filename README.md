Palisades Parks Service

My EnjoyTheOutdoors project is entitled Palisades Parks, which allows users to search through all national parks by the state they are located in, the type of park, or simply looking through all parks available.  The parks and mountain information were all supplied by JSON files.

The primary goals I set for myself on this project was to try to use more native CSS in conjunction with Bootstrap, and to do all JavaScript with no global code and all anonymous functions.
